# DSA Lab 2 (lab 10) SLL and Checkbox

#### The layout HTML/CSS portion is on [*my codepen*](https://codepen.io/0smium/pen/rzzvqd).

#### The list portion with one *stretch goal* is included here.

##### Instructions:

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/0smium/lab-10-link-list-and-checkbox.git`
- Navigate to the directory `lab-10-link-list-and-checkbox/lab-steve`
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm test`

##### Tests:

- **appendNode():** three tests for the creation of a new SLL and appending nodes `head = new SLL()` and head.appendNode().
- **remove():** three tests the `remove` method for removing nodes from the SLL `head.remove(head)`.
- **forEach:** three tests for the `forEach` method for the ability to carry out a callback on each node in the SLL `head.forEach(each => CB(each))`.
- **findMiddle():** three tests for the `findMiddle` method (**STRETCH GOAL**), which finds the middle node of an SLL or the closest, lowest node in the case of an even length SLL `head.findMiddle()`.
- **reverse():** three tests for the `reverse` method which reverses the order of nodes in the SLL.
